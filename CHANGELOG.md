## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2-beta] — 2026-09-13

Bundles JSRay Core 0.0.2-beta.5, the last beta of Core's 0.0.2 line.

### Added
- **Sass and Less in the block's language picker.** Core recognised both; the
  picker listed SCSS alone.

### Changed
- **Bundled Core is 0.0.2-beta.5.** The 0.0.1-beta zip shipped 0.0.1-beta.5;
  the 0.0.2-beta.1 recorded below was synced afterwards and never reached a
  released zip. On a site:
  - A comment holding two quotes stays one comment, and a string holding `//`,
    `#` or `/* */` stays one string, in every grammar. 27 grammars used to cut
    a comment such as `// don't stop, won't stop` at its first apostrophe.
  - PHP heredocs and nowdocs, shell and Ruby heredocs, Ruby's `%w[]` family,
    Perl's `q{}` family and Elixir sigils render as literals instead of as code.
  - A JavaScript template nested inside a placeholder no longer ends the outer
    one early, and private class members such as `#count` are coloured.
- **Core drift is reported, not failed on.** CI warns while the bundled Core is
  behind the published one and stays green; `npm run build` keeps the strict
  check, because an integration syncs Core when it releases, not when Core does.
  CI had been running that strict gate on every push, which went unnoticed until
  Core first moved ahead; it now calls the packaging script directly.
- The sync workflow retires what a newer Core makes obsolete — its own issues
  and `core/*` branches — instead of leaving one of each per Core release.
- Install points at the release zip and the `SHA256SUMS.txt` beside it, and
  every link names the `jsrayorg` organisation.

### Fixed
- Both READMEs described an internal test build with no public beta through the
  whole public beta. The phase check only asked whether the right phrase was
  present; it now also fails while the wrong one is.
- The banner, icon and screenshots WordPress.org renders existed nowhere. They
  are in `.wordpress-org/`, for the SVN `assets/` folder beside `trunk/`.
- A version ladder in CONTRIBUTING contradicted the paragraph above it.
- Commit subjects are checked here and on pull requests, not only in Core and
  not only by the local hook.

## [0.0.1-beta] — 2026-08-24

Continues the 0.0.1 beta line. The major version tracks the bundled Core's, so this stays on 0.x until Core reaches 1.0, and the beta label stays until the plugin's own surface has stopped moving.

### Added

- **Shortcodes reach everything blocks can do.** `[jsray]` accepts a filename, a copy button, line numbers, a `highlight="3,7-9"` line spec and a custom class, and renders through the same path the block does.
- **Line highlighting**, and **hovering a line lights it**. The band is drawn from the gutter, which is the only per-line element in the markup — JSRay replaces the whole `innerHTML` when it re-tokenizes, so a wrapper per line would not survive. Hover therefore needs line numbers to be on.

### Changed

- **Bundled JSRay Core 0.0.2-beta.1.** It corrects a regression the previous snapshot carried: an apostrophe in a Rust line comment was read as a lifetime, so `// don't do this` was cut at the apostrophe and the rest of the line rendered as code. English comments in Rust are full of them.

### Fixed

- **Shortcode output was unstyled.** The stylesheet registered by `block.json` is enqueued only when that block is on the page, and a shortcode is not that block, so the markup carried `.jsray-block` classes with nothing behind them.
- **Every line came out double-spaced.** `wpautop` writes `<br />` followed by a real newline and the renderer already emits the newline.
- **The highlight band was 45px wide** instead of spanning the row: `right: -100%` resolves against the `<li>`, not an ancestor.
- **Line numbers drifted whenever a theme wrapped code.** `pre { white-space: pre-wrap }` is the standard theme fix for code overflowing on phones, and it adds a visual row the gutter has no item for — every number below the wrap then labelled the wrong line. Wrapping is now pinned off where line numbers are shown, and the code scrolls horizontally instead.

### Changed

- **`load_plugin_textdomain()` removed.** Discouraged since WordPress 4.6, and it loaded no file here — only a `.pot` ships. Translations arrive from translate.wordpress.org, or from the just-in-time loader for a bundled `.mo`.
- **Verified on WordPress 7.1** with PHP 8.3, and on 6.0 with PHP 7.4. The official Plugin Check reports no errors and no warnings against the packaged plugin.

### From the first internal builds

- **Custom colors.** A palette exported by the JSRay Theme Studio overrides any of the 23 token classes on top of the selected palette. Keys are validated against the token vocabulary synced from the bundled Core, values must be real colors — `url()`, `var()` and a stray semicolon are refused, because these are written straight into a style block — and unknown keys are dropped rather than rejecting the whole palette, so one written for a newer Core still works here.
- **Core integrity verification.** `core-integrity.json` pins the digests Core published for the bundled snapshot. The plugin hashes each asset against them, reports the result on the settings screen, and raises an admin notice when the bundled renderer no longer matches its official build. The notice is conditional and limited to `manage_options`: it appears when something is wrong, not on every page load.
- `npm run test:compat` runs the PHP suite and a rendered page against WordPress 6.0 on PHP 7.4 as well as the current release, so `Requires at least` and `Requires PHP` describe something that was exercised rather than assumed.
- **Hovering a line lights it.** The code column has no per-line element to hover — JSRay replaces the whole `innerHTML` when it re-tokenizes, so a wrapper per line would not survive — so the pointer's vertical position is resolved against the gutter items and the band `highlight="3,7-9"` already draws is reused. Each item's own rectangle is measured rather than dividing by line height, which assumes nothing about padding and stays correct if the theme changes the leading. It uses the same `lineHighlight` palette colour as the static band, because that is the only line-level surface in the 23-key vocabulary and adding a key is a governed Core change. **Requires line numbers to be on** — without the gutter there is no per-line node in the markup to hang the band on.
- **Line numbers no longer drift when a theme wraps code.** The gutter holds one `<li>` per logical line, so it stays aligned only while one logical line occupies one visual row. `pre { white-space: pre-wrap }` is the standard theme fix for code overflowing on phones — many ship it with `!important` — and it silently adds a visual row the gutter has no item for. Every number below the wrap then labelled the wrong line, and the last line got none at all. Found on a live site, not in these tests: a 17-line Python snippet showed `if list1 is None:` as line 9 when it was line 8. Where line numbers are on, wrapping is now pinned off and the code column scrolls horizontally instead — the trade every code host makes, and better than numbers that lie. Blocks without line numbers keep whatever wrapping the theme chose.
- A stored custom palette silently outranked the palette picker with nothing in the UI saying so, which made switching palettes look broken. The Palette field now names every value the custom colors override.
- Shortcode content passed through `wpautop` and `wptexturize` before the shortcode ran, so code arrived carrying literal `<br />` markers and curly quotes — code a reader could not copy and run.
- `align` and `anchor` were accepted by the block editor and dropped by the render callback, which built its own class string instead of calling `get_block_wrapper_attributes()`.
- Bundled Core is **0.0.1-beta.4**. That snapshot fixes a denial of service present in every earlier one: an unterminated interpolating string sent four grammars into exponential backtracking, and rendering is synchronous, so a post containing a half-finished code block could hold a reader's tab. Measured here, the same input went from over two seconds to three milliseconds.
- CI fails when the bundled Core is behind the published Core. The previous drift check compared against a sibling checkout and skipped silently when Core was absent — every CI run — so a stale engine passed a green build. A scheduled workflow now opens a sync pull request when Core moves.
- Repository documentation matches the ecosystem baseline: LICENSE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY and Code of Conduct, with the shared brand header and a Simplified Chinese README.

## [0.0.1-internal.2] — 2026-07-02

### Status
- Internal test build; not a public beta.

### Added
- Core snapshot 0.0.1-internal.2 with 13 additional language families.
- Loader test harness and CI workflow (Node 18 / 20 / 22).

### Changed
- Project id renamed `jsray-wordpress` → `jsray-wp`.
- Core drift check is advisory day-to-day and strict at the packaging gate (`JSRAY_STRICT_DRIFT=1`).
- Official project emails adopted; CI `GITHUB_TOKEN` pinned to read-only.

### Fixed
- Core snapshot carrying the `applyTheme` root fix, so runtime theme changes are no longer shadowed by the theme stylesheet.

## [0.0.1-internal.1] — 2026-07-01

### Status
- Internal test build; not a public beta. Split out of the Core repository into its own project.

### Added
- WordPress plugin around JSRay Core: the **JSRay Code** block, a shortcode, and a compatibility path for native Code blocks.
- Settings screen (theme mode, fallback language, front-end asset toggles).
- Renderer adapter hooks — six PHP filters plus `window.JSRayWP.renderer` — so a host site can extend or replace the renderer.
- `tools/sync-core.sh` and `tools/check-versions.mjs` to bundle Core assets and catch snapshot drift.
