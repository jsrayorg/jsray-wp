/**
 * Report when the bundled Core snapshot is older than the published Core.
 *
 * Advisory by default; fails only with `--strict` or JSRAY_STRICT_DRIFT=1.
 *
 * This repository does not depend on Core at runtime — it vendors a copy,
 * because a WordPress plugin is a zip dropped onto a host with no package
 * manager. That copy does not update itself, so a fix in Core reaches a user
 * only when someone re-syncs here and releases.
 *
 * Nothing used to notice when no one had. The existing drift check compares
 * against a sibling checkout and skips silently when Core is absent, which is
 * every CI run — so this repository could sit on an old engine indefinitely
 * with a green build, and did: Core 0.0.1-beta.3 fixed a denial of service
 * that stayed in the bundle here until someone thought to look.
 *
 * The registry being unreachable is not a failure; being behind is.

// something a repository maintains continuously. Failing here on every push
// would demand the one thing that is not possible, and the noise would be paid
// for daily.
//
// The gate is where it can be met: nothing may be packaged from a stale
// engine. That is what `--strict` is for, and it is wired into each repository's
